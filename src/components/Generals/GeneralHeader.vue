          This interface provides a comprehensive display of information for champions featured in
          League of Legends. Each champion entry includes their avatar, name, in-game price, and a
          brief description highlighting their abilities, lore, and unique characteristics. In
          addition to viewing existing champions, the interface also offers a functionality to add
          new champions. This ensures that the champion database remains up-to-date and allows
          administrators or authorized users to continuously expand the collection as new champions
          are introduced into the game.
